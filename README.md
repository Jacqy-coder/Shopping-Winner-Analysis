# 🛍️ How Do Shopping Outlets Pick Winners?  
### 🎯 A Data-Driven RFM Segmentation Approach

Have you ever wondered how winners in loyalty programs are selected fairly?  
Many shopping outlets rely on **RFM segmentation**—a powerful data-driven method that analyzes:

- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency**: How often they purchase  
- **Monetary**: How much they spend

---

## 📊 Project Overview

In this analysis, I used a **mock pharmaceutical dataset** to explore how RFM scores can help identify high-value customers. Here's how each metric was calculated:

- **Recency**: Number of days since the last purchase  
- **Frequency**: Total number of transactions  
- **Monetary**: Total spending amount

Each customer was scored from **1 to 5** in each category. A customer with a score of **555** is highly engaged—recent buyer, frequent purchaser, and high spender.

## 🔍 Insights & Impact

- Identifies high-value customers for **rewards and re-engagement**  
- Provides actionable insights for marketing, retention, and sales strategy  
- Applicable across industries like **retail, healthcare, and e-commerce**

## 📈 Tools Used
- **Power BI** (Dashboarding & Visualization)  
- **Excel / Python** (Data transformation and scoring logic)

## 💡 Key Takeaway

> **RFM segmentation is more than just analytics—it’s a strategy to understand and reward your best customers!**
